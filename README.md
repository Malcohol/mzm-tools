# mzm-tools

Scripts to parse MazezaM level files (.mzm) and generate various types of output (currently ZX Basic, ZX81 asm and BASICODE).
Generally speaking, I start work on a new type of output by copying and pasting existing code, which is why I keep the
output generation code together in one project.
